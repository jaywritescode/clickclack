===========

A old-school typewriter effect for pretty websites
--------------------------------------------------

click-clack is the [sound](https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/typewriter/) an old-school typewriter makes when you press a letter key. I was hunting for some interesting dynamic effect to throw on my admittedly-boring home page. A few developers beat me to writing some code that renders the next letter at regular intervals, but I wanted an effect that included a bit more of the stochasticism of human typing.

Features
--------

- [x] Configurable timing for each and every keystroke!
- [x] Records your typing errors, and also your deleting your typing errors!
- [ ] Includes element nodes in the replay, for CSS and stuff!
